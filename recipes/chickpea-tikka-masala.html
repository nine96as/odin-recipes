    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Chickpea tikka masala is a delightful and hearty vegetarian dish that's
      become a beloved favorite in both Indian cuisine and international dining.
      At the heart of this flavorful creation are tender chickpeas, which soak
      up the rich and aromatic tomato-based gravy infused with a medley of
      spices. The chickpeas are often marinated in a yogurt and spice blend,
      allowing them to absorb the vibrant flavors before being simmered to
      perfection. This dish is characterized by its bold and complex taste
      profile, with a harmonious blend of spices such as cumin, coriander, garam
      masala, and paprika, lending layers of warmth and depth to every bite. The
      addition of cream or coconut milk brings a creamy, indulgent texture to
      the dish, perfectly balancing the spices and creating a luxurious
      mouthfeel.

    <p>
      Chickpea tikka masala is not only a flavorful culinary masterpiece but

      taste or satisfaction. Whether served over a bed of fragrant basmati rice
      or accompanied by warm naan bread, chickpea tikka masala is a comfort food
      that transcends borders, bringing people together over its inviting aroma
      and mouthwatering flavors. Its popularity has grown globally, highlighting
