    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Lasagna is a classic Italian pasta dish that has gained immense popularity
      worldwide. This delectable culinary creation consists of layers of flat,
      wide pasta noodles, typically made from durum wheat semolina, stacked with
      rich and flavorful ingredients. The heart of lasagna lies in its luscious
      layers of creamy b√©chamel sauce, tangy tomato sauce, and a generous
      filling of seasoned ground meat, often beef or pork, mixed with onions,
      garlic, and herbs. Additionally, lasagna is renowned for its generous use
      of grated cheese, with mozzarella and Parmesan being popular choices,
      providing a delightful gooey and golden topping when baked to perfection.
      This harmonious layering of textures and flavors results in a savory,
      mouthwatering dish that captures the essence of Italian comfort food.
