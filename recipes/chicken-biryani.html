    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Chicken biryani is a cherished and iconic dish in Indian cuisine that
      embodies the perfect fusion of flavors, spices, and textures. At its core,
      biryani consists of succulent pieces of chicken, marinated in a fragrant
      blend of spices, herbs, and yogurt, resulting in tender and flavorful
      meat. The rice is another essential component, often long-grain basmati
      rice, which is parboiled and then layered with the marinated chicken and
      aromatic ingredients. The layers are further enriched with saffron-infused
      milk, which imparts a beautiful golden hue and a subtle floral fragrance
      to the rice. This symphony of flavors is perfected through slow cooking,
      allowing the spices to meld together, creating a tantalizing and complex
      taste that leaves a lasting impression.
    </p>
    <p>
      What sets chicken biryani apart is its diversity, as it is prepared in
      various regional styles across India, each with its own unique twist.
      Whether it's the Hyderabadi dum biryani with its slow-cooked layers, the
      Kolkata biryani featuring potatoes, or the Lucknowi biryani known for its
      delicate and aromatic preparation, there's a biryani for every palate.
      This beloved dish is not only a testament to the rich culinary heritage of
      India but also a testament to the love and passion that goes into its
      preparation, making it a celebratory centerpiece at gatherings, weddings,
      and special occasions, where it brings people together to savor its
      delectable taste and share in the joy of communal dining.

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Gather all ingredients.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet. Fry potatoes in hot oil
          until lightly browned, about 3 to 5 minutes. Remove to a paper
          towel-lined plate to drain; set aside.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Add remaining 2 tablespoons of oil to the skillet. Add onions, garlic,
          and fresh ginger; cook and stir until onion is soft and golden. Add
          tomatoes, salt, cumin, chili powder, pepper, and turmeric; cook,
          stirring constantly, for 5 minutes.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Stir in yogurt, mint, ground cardamom, and cinnamon stick. Cover and
          cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes are cooked
          to a pulp. It may be necessary to add a little hot water if mixture
          becomes too dry and starts to stick to the pan.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Add chicken and stir well to coat. Cover and cook over very low heat
          until chicken is tender, 35 to 45 minutes. There should only be a
          little very thick gravy left when chicken is finished cooking. If
          necessary cook uncovered for a few minutes to reduce the gravy.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, make the rice: Wash rice well and drain in a colander for
          at least 30 minutes.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Heat oil in a large skillet. Add onion; cook and stir until golden.
          Add cardamom pods, cloves, cinnamon stick, ground ginger, and saffron;
          stir in rice until coated with spices.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Heat stock and salt in a medium pot until hot; pour over rice and stir
          well.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Add chicken mixture and potatoes; stir gently to combine. Bring to a
          boil.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Reduce heat to very low, cover with a tight-fitting lid, and steam for
          20 minutes without lifting the lid or stirring.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Spoon biryani onto a warm serving dish.</p>
      </li>
